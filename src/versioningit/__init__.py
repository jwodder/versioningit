Versioning It with your Version In Git

``versioningit`` is yet another setuptools plugin for automatically determining
your package's version based on your Git repository's tags.  Unlike others, it
allows easy customization of the version format and even lets you easily
override the separate functions used for version extraction & calculation.

**Features:**

- Installed & configured through :pep:`518`'s ``pyproject.toml``

- Supports Git, modern Git archives, and Mercurial

- Formatting of the final version uses format template strings, with fields for
  basic VCS information and separate template strings for distanced vs. dirty
  vs. distanced-and-dirty repository states

- Can optionally write the final version to a file for loading at runtime

- Provides custom setuptools commands for inserting the final version into a
  source file at build time

- The individual methods for VCS querying, tag-to-version calculation, version
  bumping, version formatting, and writing the version to a file can all be
  customized using either functions defined alongside one's project code or via
  publicly-distributed entry points

- Can alternatively be used as a library for use in ``setup.py`` or the like,
  in case you don't want to or can't configure it via ``pyproject.toml``

- The only thing it does is calculate your version and optionally write it to a
  file; there's no overriding of your sdist contents based on what's in your
  Git repository, especially not without a way to turn it off, because that
  would just be rude.
